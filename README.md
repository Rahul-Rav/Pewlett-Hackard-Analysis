# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview
Pewlett Hackard is a large company with several thousand employees. With baby boomers beginning to retire, the company is offering retirment packages to those who meet a certain criteria, and begins to think about which positions that need to be filled in the near-future due to the upcoming retirements. 
We are tasked with finding out who exactly will be retiring and how many positions that will need to be filled.
Using SQL we build and employee database with the initial 6 CSV files we are provided with by the company.
Beyond this initial task, we are assigned to ddetermine the number of retiring employees per title, and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

### Results

* There are 90,398 employees retiring according to the unique_titles.csv file that we created
* Senior Engineer is the position with most upcoming retirements, at 29,414 employees.
* Senior Staff is a close second, with the next highest position with most upcoming retiremnts, at 28,254 employees.
  Two of the highest retirment positions are senior level employees.
* Based on the large amount of senior staff retiring and the lack of leadership positions, the company may want to prioritize incentivizing existing staff to take part in the mentorship program.

### Summary
Out of the 90,398 employees at Pewlett Hackard, 41,380 of them are eligible for retirment. Unsurprisingly, the two highest retiring employee positions are Senior Engineer and Senior Staff; two high level positions that the company needs to prioritize filling as soon as possible depending on how many employees decide to stay to take part in the mentorship program.
Due to the sheer number of employees at Pewlett Hackard, if there is an equal amount of employees retiring and new employees being hired, the amount of potential mentors to the ratio of mentees needs to be analyzed to gain a deeper insight of the practicality of potentially assigning to many new-hires to a single mentor.
